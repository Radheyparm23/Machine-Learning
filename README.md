Hello Coders!
I had created a repository for you.
Topic is: "Old Car Data Price Prediction".
In this you are getting a "Supervised Data Machine Learning" project.
I had taken data of "Quikr Cars" to analyze and train further.
And pickle file is given, if you want to implement this project into website or application (".pkl") is going to be used.
